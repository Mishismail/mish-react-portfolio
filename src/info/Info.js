  bio: `<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Hi there! I'm Mishka, a full-stack web developer from Cape Town, with a deep passion for problem-solving and technology. 
  After a few years as a Senior Customer Experience associate, I've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of Full Stack and Front-End Development. 
  My current focus is on mastering the MERN stack, where I've been combining my expertise in delivering top-notch customer experiences with my growing technical skills.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
  I'm dedicated to continuously learning and evolving in this dynamic field, and I'm always exploring new technologies to expand my skill set. 
  As I progress, I plan to dive deeper into mobile development with React Native and explore other frameworks like Angular and eventually dig into Python.
  Outside of coding, I enjoy a quiet life where I can focus on honing my craft and relaxing with a bit of Sims 4. 
  </p>`,
